# S4BDatabase
Tools that make (probably unsupported) use of Skype for Business and Lync Server databases

Get-UpdatedConferenceURL takes a user's current SIP Address and gets back all the Lync/SfB-specific meeting information that went into the invitations. This is mostly of interest for users whose SIP Addresses have been changed, to make re-sending their meeting invites easier.
